```env
# Firebase Configuration (from Firebase Console > Project Settings)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id

## Firebase Configuration Guide

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Authentication** and enable Email/Password sign-in method.
3. Set up **Firestore Database** in production mode.
4. Configure security rules to protect your data (example below):
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. Go to Project Settings > General > Your Apps > Web App and copy the Firebase configuration.
6. Add these values to your `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variables.
